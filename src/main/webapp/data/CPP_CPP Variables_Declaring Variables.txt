<b><h2>C++ Variables</h2></b>

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false


<b><h2>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h2></b>

To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

<h4>Syntax</h4>
type variableName = value;


Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:

int myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;


You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

int myNum;
myNum = 15;
cout << myNum;


Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
cout << myNum;  // Outputs 10


<b><h2>Declare Many Variables</h2></b>
To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:

<b><h4>Example</h4></b>
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;


<b><h2>One Value to Multiple Variables</h2></b>
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

<b><h4>Example</h4></b>
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
