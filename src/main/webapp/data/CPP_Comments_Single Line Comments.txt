<b><h2>Single-line Comments</h2></b>

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:


// This is a comment
cout << "Hello World!";
